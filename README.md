# Iterators - Code-Along

This activity will be walked through by your instructor.

**Your participation is critical to your understanding**, so please respond when asked by the instructor and ask any questions you may have immediately.

Please do not be afraid to ask questions.  Chances are very good that others have the same and/or similar questions and are bashful about asking.  They will appreciate your asking the question.

This activity will add code to an existing class that will implement it as a subclass of the [PlayingCard class](https://github.com/BloomTechBackend/bd-inheritance-code-along-starter/blob/main/src/com/frank/model/PlayingCard.java#L1-L90) used in the Inheritance Guided Project

Successful completion will be when all we have successfully implemented the subclass and are able to use it and its methods in an application program.

- IntelliJ with Java 11
- If you're running the code from your terminal, make sure you have Java 11 installed on your machine (not just in IntelliJ)
